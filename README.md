# Color Picker App
Color Picker App written with React.js library. App allows user to choose a color and return the hex code of color and visual back to user. 

## Technologies Used:

### React.js

The project was mainly written in the ColorPicker.jsx file, where HTML components and JS functions can be written in the same file.

React was used for the useState() hook, where a color variable could be created, and updated in real time with the setter function once the user picks a color. This allows the handlecolorchange() function to reuse the same variable and output different results depending on user selection. 

### HTML

Created color picker container consisting of a color type input component where users can pick their desired color, and display the color in hex codes.

### CSS

CSS styling was used to apply design to color container, display, and overall layout in index.css file.
